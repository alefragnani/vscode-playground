# VS Code Playground

The idea of this repo is to be a place where I can play with **VS Code extension development**.

It will have not only API testing but also samples used while answering questions on [VS Code Community Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode)
